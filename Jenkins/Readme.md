# Jenkins Essentials 🚀

## 🌟 Introduction to CI Process

### What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository. Each integration is automatically verified by:

- **Automated Build Processes** 📦
- **Automated Testing** ✅

This ensures the early detection of integration issues and maintains a high-quality codebase.

### Benefits of CI
- 🕒 **Faster Feedback Loop**: Detect issues early.
- 🔒 **Improved Code Quality**: Continuous testing and validation.
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Teams work cohesively.
- 📈 **Efficiency**: Streamlined development workflow.

## 🌐 Difference Between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment

| Aspect                        | Continuous Delivery 🚚                             | Continuous Deployment 🚀                              |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                | Ensures code is always in a deployable state.    | Automatically deploys every change to production.|
| **Deployment Trigger**        | Manual approval for production release.          | Fully automated without manual intervention.     |
| **Use Case**                  | Suitable for environments requiring compliance.  | Ideal for rapid release environments.            |
| **Automation Level**          | High, except production deployment.              | Fully automated, end-to-end.                     |

## 🛠️ Installing Jenkins Server

### Prerequisites
1. A server with **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)** OS. 🐧
2. **Java** installed (Jenkins requires Java 11 or later). ☕

### Steps to Install Jenkins

#### Step 1️⃣: Update Your System
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### Step 2️⃣: Install Java
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```
Verify Java installation:
```bash
java -version
```

#### Step 3️⃣: Add Jenkins Repository
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

#### Step 4️⃣: Install Jenkins
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```

#### Step 5️⃣: Start and Enable Jenkins Service
```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

#### Step 6️⃣: Access Jenkins Web Interface
1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<your-server-ip>:8080
   ```
2. Retrieve the initial admin password:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
   ```
3. Complete the setup wizard and install suggested plugins.

---

## 📖 Summary
- CI processes automate integration and testing.
- Continuous Delivery focuses on deployable code, while Continuous Deployment fully automates releases.
- Jenkins is a powerful tool for CI/CD with robust features and plugins.
- Installation involves adding repositories, installing Java, and setting up Jenkins on a Linux server.

# Jenkins Essentials: Freestyle Job and Git Plugin

### 🚀 **Create Your First Freestyle Job**
A **Freestyle Job** in Jenkins is a basic project that allows you to configure and automate simple tasks, such as building code or running scripts. Here's how to create your first freestyle job:

1. **Log in to Jenkins**
   - Open your Jenkins dashboard in your browser.
   - Use your admin credentials to log in.

2. **Create a New Job**
   - Click on `New Item` from the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Enter the **name** for your job (e.g., `MyFirstFreestyleJob`).
   - Select `Freestyle project` and click `OK`.

3. **Configure the Job**
   - **Description**: Add a meaningful description for your job.
   - **Source Code Management**: Select `None` for now.
   - **Build Triggers**: Choose the appropriate trigger, such as "Build periodically" or "Poll SCM" if applicable.
   - **Build Steps**: Add a build step like `Execute shell` and provide the command to execute.

4. **Save and Build**
   - Click `Save` to save the configuration.
   - Click `Build Now` to execute the job.

5. **View Build Results**
   - Check the console output by clicking on the build number in the Build History section.

### 🔧 **Install Git Plugin**
To pull source code from a Git repository, you need to install the Git plugin.

1. **Navigate to Plugin Manager**
   - Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins`.

2. **Search for Git Plugin**
   - Under the `Available` tab, search for `Git Plugin`.
   - Select the plugin and click `Install without restart`.

3. **Verify Installation**
   - After installation, go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Installed Plugins` and ensure the `Git Plugin` is listed.

4. **Set Up Global Git Configuration** *(Optional)*
   - Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Configure System`.
   - Under `Git`, add global configurations like `Name` and `Email` for Git commits.

### 🌟 **Create Freestyle Job to Pull Source Code**
Here are the steps to create a freestyle job that pulls source code from a Git repository:

1. **Create a New Freestyle Job**
   - From the Jenkins dashboard, click `New Item`.
   - Enter the job name (e.g., `PullSourceCodeJob`) and select `Freestyle project`. Click `OK`.

2. **Configure Source Code Management**
   - In the job configuration page, go to `Source Code Management`.
   - Select `Git`.
   - Enter the Git repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo.git`).
   - Provide credentials if the repository is private.

3. **Build Steps**
   - Add a build step to verify the code, such as `Execute shell` with a command like:
     ```bash
     ls -l
     ```

4. **Save and Build**
   - Click `Save` to save the job configuration.
   - Trigger a build by clicking `Build Now`.

5. **Verify Build**
   - Check the console output to ensure the code is pulled successfully.

### 🤔 **Tips and Suggestions**
- Use the **Build Triggers** to automate jobs (e.g., poll the repository for changes).
- Test the repository URL in a local terminal before adding it to Jenkins.
- Use the Git plugin's advanced options to handle branches, tags, and shallow clones.
